### Create Amorphic datasets for forecasting

- Step 1 - Data for forcasting has already beem prepared and the two datatsets in csv file format can be downloaded here -  [Target](./media/Target.csv), [Related](./media/Related.csv)

i) Target csv attributes: These are the mandatory attributes required for forecasting. It includes the following columns and we will be required to specify repsective formats for each attribute as we go through the steps later-

|      | Fields      | Format |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | 
| 1.| Format       | float64        |  
| 2.| timestamp       | datetime64[ns]       |  
| 3.| item_id       | object      |  


ii) Related attributes : These are additional attributes we are looking to include in the forecasting process. We will be required to specify repsective formats for each attribute as we go through the steps later -

|Fields | Format |
| :----: | :----: | 
|Store_Name|               object|
|Region        |              object|
|food_or_non_food  |          object|
|Division          |          object|
|Main_Category_Name  |object|
|COGS_in_NNBP     |     object|
|Gross_Profit_pct    |       object|
|timestamp            |   datetime64[ns]|
|item_id             |          object|

- Step 2 - Create Amorphic datasets for the “Target” & the “Related” csv files respectively. 
The following screenshots have sample values and connection configuration for the ‘Target’ & the ‘Related’ datasets to be created in Amorphic.

![Create Dataset](./media/related_sample_values_and_connection.png)

After registering the dataset, we navigate to the "Files" tab as shown in the screen below. ‘Target.csv’ & ‘Related.csv’ files can be uploaded by clicking on this icon -

![Create Dataset](./media/Upload_Related_CSV.png)

### Setup and submit the forecasting job

- Step 1 - Navigate to the forecasting link -

![Create Dataset](./media/Navigate_To_Forecasting.png)

Create a forecast job by clicking on the link "Create Forecast Job" - 

![Create Dataset](./media/Create_Forecast_1.png)

Enter details to setup forecasting job and submit. This sets a job for running AWS Forecasting service

![Create Dataset](./media/Create_Forecast_2.png)


- Step 2 - Map datasets for the forecast job by navigating to the 'Datasets' tab -

![Create Dataset](./media/Navigate_To_Datasets.png)

i)  Map the “TargetSalesData” dataset and submit the form. Make sure the attribute formats are correctly specified as shown in the screen below  - 

![Create Dataset](./media/Map_Target_Dataset.png)

ii) Map the “Sales_Related_Data” dataset. All variables listed in the "Related attributes" section above must be mapped as "String" format with the exception of "timestamp". Submit the form once done - 

![Create Dataset](./media/Upload_Related_Dataset.png)

The above actions will take approx 20-30 mins to complete. You will need to wait for this step to complete before you can proceed to the next steps.

- Step 3 - Configure a ‘Predictor’ for the forecast job

Predictor configuration is where the algorithm to be used and the parameters that are required by the algorithm are configured. First navigate to the "Predictors" tab -

![Create Dataset](./media/Navigate_To_Predictor.png)

Click on "+" icon on the screen to create a predictor. Enter the sample values as shown in the screen below and "submit" the form -

![Create Dataset](./media/Predictor_Configuration.png)

This step will take 20-30 mins to complete.


- Step 4 - Create a version for the Forecast predictor. It uses the configuration and its associated parameters to create the version which can then be used to create an inference.

We need to navigate to the "Predictors" tab to create a version.

![Create Dataset](./media/Navigate_To_Predictor.png)

Click on the ‘+’ icon to create a new version for the predictor. Add tags for the version. Tags can be associated with a version for distinguishing it from other versions.

![Create Dataset](./media/create_version.png)

This step will take 20-30 mins to complete.


- Step 5 - Create an inference and submit the job.

Navigate to the "Inferences" tab -

![Create Dataset](./media/Inference_Tab.png)

Click on "+" icon to create an Inference.  

![Create Dataset](./media/Create_Inference.png)

This step will take approx. 30 mins to complete. Inference generates a csv file based on the input. The file generated can be downloaded or can be saved directly to an Amorphic Dataset. 


- Step 6 - Download predictions once the job has completed. The link to download the files can seen in the screen below -

![Create Dataset](./media/Download_Predictions.png)

We have three predictions in the output representing varying confidance levels - P10, P50 & P90. A sample output is as follows -

![Create Dataset](./media/prediction_results.png)

The csv file with the predictions can be downloaded here - 
[Predictions ](./media/Mapped_Prediction.csv)

### Store predictions for dashboarding

- Step 1 - Create a dataset with the predictions downloaded from the forecasting job. 

![Create Dataset](./media/Create_Predictions_Dataset.png)
 
- Step 2 - Upload the csv file (Mapped_Prediction.csv) into the dataset by clicking on the upload icon. The file will be uploaded as follows.

- Step 3 - The predictions can be queried by navigating to the "Query Engine" -
