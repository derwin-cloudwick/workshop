When you create a dashboard, the typical workflow looks like this:
- Create a new analysis.
- Add new or existing datasets.
- Choose fields to create the first chart. QuickSight automatically suggests the best visualization.
- Add more charts, tables, or insights to the analysis. Resize and rearrange them on one or more sheets.
- Use extended features to add variables, custom controls, colors, additional pages (called sheets), and more.
- Publish the analysis as a dashboard to share it with other people.

Dashboards come in a wide variety of designs, depending on what you do and the analytics that you need to do it well. Using QuickSight, you can interact with your data on a webpage or your mobile device. If you also subscribe by mail, you can see a static preview of it.
